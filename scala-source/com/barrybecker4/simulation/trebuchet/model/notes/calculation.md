# Calculation Notes

See [tebuchet physics](https://www.real-world-physics-problems.com/trebuchet-physics.html).

Optimal configuration based on his definition of "range efficiency" is such that:

- The initial release position is when the beam on the counterweight side makes an angle of 45Â° with the vertical. 
- The length of the long arm of the beam (on the payload side) is 3.75 times the length of the short arm of the beam (on the counterweight side). 
- The length of the sling is equal to the length of the long arm of the beam (on the payload side).
- The counterweight has a mass 100x the payload (but it can be less and still get good results).
